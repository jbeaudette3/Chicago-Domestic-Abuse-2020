This code uses a combination of SQL/Python to pull data from Google's BigQuery free datasets and plot the graphs.

In order to run the SQL code, you must first have your own account with BigQuery and replace [name] with your own project name. It's recommended to run the SQL code in separate code cells - it didn't work for me to run everything as a single block.

Please double check my code.
Please be safe, wash your hands.
